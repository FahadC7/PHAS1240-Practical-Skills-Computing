# PHAS1240-Practical-Skill---Computing
Nine in class sessions teaching basic Python skills with scripts. A longer task involving calculating physical constants from experimental data from a cathode ray tube experiment. A final assignment in which an Angry Birds like game set in space is created using VPython with physics obeying Newtons law of universal gravitation.

## Course Objectives:
- Use computers to analyse experimental data, and thus, by comparison with physical models, evaluate the appropriateness of the model 
- Gain experience in mapping a physics problem onto a computational framework 
- Used computers to model, visualize and solve physical systems 
- Use the Python programming language to produce documented computer code that is clear, efficient, reusable and follows good coding practice
